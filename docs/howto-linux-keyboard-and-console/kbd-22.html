		<p>Several people have noticed that they lose typed characters when
		a floppy disk is active. It seems that this might be a problem with
		Uni-486WB motherboards.</p>

		<p>Tjalling Tjalkens (<code>tjalling@ei.ele.tue.nl</code>) reports very similar problems
		with "a no-brand GMB-486 UNP Vesa motherboard with AMD 486DX2-66 CPU" -
		during floppy activity some keystrokes are lost, during floppy tape streamer
		(Conner C 250 MQ) activity many keystrokes are lost.</p>

		<p>Some people experience sporadic lockups - sometimes associated to
		hard disk activity or other I/O.</p>

		<p>There may be a relation between keyboard problems and the video card in use.</p>

		even more annoying because guess what that does :-( ).
		Switching to a Creative Labs Graphics Blaster MA202 solved the problem.
		I'm assuming the Stealth 64 did something funny with the timings.'</p>
