		<p>There are two ways to get a screen to scroll.
		The first, called `hard scrolling', is to leave the text in
		video memory as it is, but change the viewing origin. This is
		very fast.
		The second, called `soft scrolling', involves moving all screen text
		up or down. This is much slower.
		The kernel console driver will write text starting at the top of
		the video memory, continuing to the bottom, then copy the bottom
		part to the top again, and continue, all the time using hard scrolling
		to show the right part on the screen.
		You can scroll back until the top op the video memory by using
		Shift-PageUp (the grey PageUp) and scroll down again using
		Shift-PageDown (the grey PageDown), assuming a default keymap.
		The amount of scrollback is thus limited to the amount of video memory
		you happen to have and you cannot increase this amount.
		If you need more scrollback, use some program that
		buffers the text, like <code>less</code> or <code>screen</code> - by using
		a buffer on disk you can go back to what you did last week.
		(One can set the amount of scrollback for <code>xterm</code> by
		adding a line like <code>XTerm*saveLines: 2500</code> in <code>.Xresources</code>.)

		<p>Upon changing virtual consoles, the screen content of the old VT
		is copied to kernel memory, and the screen content of the new VT
		is copied from kernel memory to video memory. Only the visible screen
		is copied, not all of video memory, so switching consoles means
		losing the scrollback information.

		<p>Sometimes, hard scrolling is undesirable, for example when the hardware
		does not have the possibility to change viewing origin. The first
		example was a Braille machine that would render the top of video
		memory in Braille. There is a kernel boot-time option <code>no-scroll</code>
		to tell the console driver not to use hard scrolling.
		See bootparam(7).
